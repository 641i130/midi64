# NOTES:
## Buttons
- Buttons are 24mm because 30mm is too big
	- ACTUALLY it depends, because the button size should be around 20-24, but the casing for the button can be around 30-33mm... I'm gonna do more research...
- They are called 'sanwa' Japanese arcade buttons
- I'm trying to find a place with rea
- ITs gotta be 24mm... I'll order some to test size? or just do my math correctly... time to open up fusion 360 for a sketch!
- OK It is confirmed, they use OBSC-24 Sanwa clear arcade buttons.


## Software/Firmware
- I think I'll use either qmk to program the backend with its midi support or build something from scratch for the LED support... (I'll need to find some footprints for the RGB parts, it'll be cool)
